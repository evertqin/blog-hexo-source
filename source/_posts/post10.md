#### Day 5 -- Yoho National Park

This is probabaly one of the most amazing days of this trip. Yesterday, we bumped into two elder couples, they told us iceline trail is one of their favorite trails and they were planning to visit it the next day. I came across this trail on TripAdvisor and saw it received 5 stars reviews, so it is on our original plan.

We lived in a nice cabin in Golden, BC which is 40~60 mins away from Lake Louise. Emerald Lake was on the way so it became our first visit during the day. It is a well-established place of interest, so expect a lot of tourists. Otherwise, it is a beautiful and peaceful lake filled with Emerald color glacier water:

Our next stop before the trail is Takakkaw Falls. It's height is around 300 meters. From the bottom, it looked magnificent.

The Total length of the trail is around 20km (12 miles), it is lengthy but the elevation is only 1300 feet so it is not too bad. Since we started very lake, we didn't take the longer Yoho Valley trail. We started from Takakkaw Falls, walk all the way pass Celeste Lake. Passed by lauging river and took the little Yoho river.

The terrain along the way was quite diverse. Sometimes, you may find yourself walking in the wood, then suddenly, you are in the middle of a meadow. Sometimes, you are walking on a big patch of snow. And finally, you step above the tree line and find yourself in between mountains, glaciers and ponds.

For this trail, I suggest you start early because it is very long. Wear extra layers because it can get really cold when you get closer to the glacier.
