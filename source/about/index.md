I am a converted software developer from a biomedical field. Althougth I am not unfamaliar with programming when I was in school. The choices of programming languages were primarily high level descriptive ones such as MATLAB, R even LabView. I started serious programming since I joined Bloomberg early 2012. We had a four-month intensive UNIX, C/C++ and JavaScript training,  as long as some basical CS background knowledge.
